PhD finalist with nearly 6 years of research experience with 10+ papers in peer‐reviewed journals (700+ citations, around 80% Q1), 15+ collaborations, 5+ workshops (inc. NATO talk), and 5+ scientific fairs.

Besides scientific output, my work includes the end‐to‐end development of EmotiphAI, a platform for group physiological data collection, show‐cased at the European Commission’s Resonances III Fest, an online theatre in collaboration with Univ. Tartu, and others. This project underlined my multi‐faced skills in software architecture, front‐end and back‐end, and reflected my commitment to learning new technologies.

**Interests**: Applying artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze physiological signals for medical applications.
